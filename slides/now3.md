# The Present

## BDD Perks

- Easy to interpret syntax
- Separates test purpose from implementation
- Test chunks become more granular; more modular

// So what were the perks of BDD?

// More human description and approachable syntax

// More modular tests -- you could take chunks and quickly/easily re-use them in other tests
