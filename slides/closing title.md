## Attribution to @fat, mustache.js, and Behance
// @fat turned me onto the library agnosticism of mustache.js' tests which is impressive in and of itself (via his JSConf 2012 talk). Behance has a fluent and expressive interface for their tests which allows for quick commands like `login` and `goToHomepage`. Those two combined and ultimately lead me down this windy road.
