# The Next

```js
// Code from BDD pipe dreams OR from node-jsmin-sourcemap/test
```

// This is a separation of description from test chunk entirely; an extremely loose connection.

// We have taken the description and made it turned it into pure data. The setup, assertions, and teardown have been moved into their own file.

// This has two perks -- One, this is not just test framework agnostic but **language** agnostic. Two, we can write a skeleton ahead of time and as we think of more items to test without penalty/distraction. Three, we can effort-lessly re-use parts (yes, technically, we could do this before but that involved pre-mature effort).

// The only gotcha is semantics need to be the same.
