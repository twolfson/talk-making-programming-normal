# The History

## TDD

```js
// Code blob of some TDD
```

// This is TDD

// It is lengthy, single purpose tests based on a single premise.

// Testing that when given a set of conditions, a specific result is returned. All forms of testing break down to this. However, TDD is the simplest form of it.

// Each test is self-contained, containing setup, assertion, and teardown.

// Sometimes frameworks DRY things up a little by providing `before` and `after` methods


// (During each of these points, make sure the code example follows the same flow)
