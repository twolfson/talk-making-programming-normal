Where we have been:
  - TDD
  - brittle specifications
  - developers and non-developers don't see problems the same
Where we are:
  - BDD
  - code coverage
  - dev's and non-dev's don't see eye to eye still
Where we can go:
  - The immediate future:
    - BDD + language agnosticism (tests AS data) (show node-jsmin-sourcemap as sample)

How does this impact me?
