Where we have been:
  - TDD
  <!-- - brittle specifications -->
  <!-- - developers and non-developers don't see problems the same -->
Where we are:
  - BDD
  - code coverage
  <!-- - dev's and non-dev's don't see eye to eye still -->
Where we can go:
  - The immediate future:
    - BDD + language agnosticism (tests AS data) (show node-jsmin-sourcemap as sample)

How does this impact me?

Getting the right balance of code coverage
  - Taking it too far
  - Tests should never repeat each other
  - BDD creates a very nice amount at 70% (link article)
